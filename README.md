# Melee Ball - Mobile Side Project

For my little brother

---
## Introduction
This repository includes my personal project, melee ball, a mobile game where the player plays as a "ball" type character, and has to survive against waves of opponents.
There are a variety of differing opponents in the game, each which their own unique skills, as well as two different modes of attack for the player

The gameplay and first level is finished, and if I find the time, I'll add more levels towards the game for it to be more playable
